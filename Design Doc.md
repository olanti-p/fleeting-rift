Main idea:

1. Player finds a "glitch" in the system
2. Player explores the glitch
3. Player finds the cheat code hidden in the source code
4. Game restarts
5. Player can now use the cheatcode in game 
6. Cheat code unlocks powerful ability that lets them bypass some of the obstacles



Needed mechanics:

1. Multi-jumps - check!
2. Stamina - check!
3. Glitch area traversal 
4. Multiple biomes with teleportation between them
5. Console - check!
6. Reversable gravity
7. Enterable door (final door must be encased in walls and time-locked)


Cheat code ideas:

1. Show debug info & collisions -> unveils a hidden passage
2. Disable damage from spikes -> lets you pass through tunnel with spikes
3. Disable damage from stars -> lets you pass through tunnel with spikes
4. Disable damage from lasers -> lets you pass through tunnel with lasers
5. Disable fall damage -> lets you fall below the map edge and trigger a glitch
6. Disable all damage -> QoL (disables all damage)
7. Show map & unlock all areas -> QoL (faster progression)
8. Infinite stamina -> lets you climb a (very) high wall
9. Double jump -> lets you reach high inaccessible area
10. Infinite dash -> lets you dash across a (very) wide gap
11. Reverse gravity -> lets you fall upwards into an unclimbable hole
12. Noclip -> lets you finish the game
13. Unstuck -> lets you control character in cutscenes
14. Hardware reset -> lets you reset entire game to escape glitches
15. Time reset -> lets you reset the speedrun timer


Target glitch areas:
1. In ice biome, right next to the final goal (no hack needed)
2. On world map, when entering bastion (need unstuck hack)
3. On main menu, when entering door (need unstuck hack)
4. In cloud area, behind an invisible wall (need debug info hack)
5. In ice area, infinite wall (need infinite stamina hack, can also be solved via gravity hack)
6. In cloud area, highly positioned platform (need double jump hack)
7. In cloud area, cloud extremely far away (need infinite dash hack)
8. In ice area, tunnel with spikes (need spike immunity)
9. In bastion, tunnel with lasers (need laser immunity)
10. In bastion, tunnel with stars (need star immunity)
11. In bastion, unclimbable hole (need gravity hack)
12. In ice area, walled in final goal (need noclip hack)



Game progression:
1. Play through cloud area normally
2. Play through bastion area normally
3. Play through ice area normally
4. Reach the end, see it being encased
5. Enter glitch area #1
6. Get hint about hack menu, collect hack_1 and hack_14, reset
7. Play cloud area, enter invisible wall, enter glitch area #2
8. Collect hack_10, reset
9. Play cloud area, reach unreachable island, enter glitch area #3
10. Collect hack_9, reset
11. Play cloud area, reach high island, enter glitch area #4
12. Collect hack_5, reset
13. Play cloud area, fall beyond map bottom, enter glitch area #5
14. Collect hack_7 and hack_2
15. Play bastion area, enter corridor with spikes, enter glitch area #6
16. Collect hack_8
17. Play ice area, climb infinite wall, enter glitch area #7
18. Collect hack_3
19. Play bastion area, enter corridor with stars, enter glitch area #8
20. Collect hack_11
21. Play bastion, use gravity reverse to rise into unclimbable hole, enter glitch area #9
22. Collect hack_4 and hack_6
23. Play bastion, enter tunnel with lasers, enter glitch area #10
24. Collect hack_13
25. Open map, use unstuck hack, enter door on map, enter glitch area #11
26. Collect hack_12
27. Glitched main menu animation plays out, use unstuck hack + noclip hack, enter door in main menu, enter glitch area #12
28. Collect hack_15
29. Glitched main menu animation plays out, use map hack to open map, play ice area, use hack_12 + hack_15 to enter the final door and win the game


Notes:
On world map, it should show # of glitches when running with debug info
