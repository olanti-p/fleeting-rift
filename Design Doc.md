Main idea:

1. Player finds a "glitch" in the system
2. Player explores the glitch
3. Player finds the cheat code hidden in the source code
4. Game restarts
5. Player can now use the cheatcode in game 
6. Cheat code unlocks powerful ability that lets them bypass some of the obstacles


Cheat code ideas:

1. Show debug info & collisions -> unveils a hidden passage
2. Disable damage from spikes -> lets you pass through tunnel with spikes
3. Disable damage from stars -> lets you pass through tunnel with spikes
4. Disable damage from lasers -> lets you pass through tunnel with lasers
5. Disable fall damage -> lets you fall below the map edge and trigger a glitch
6. Disable all damage -> convenience thing (disables all damage)
7. Infinite stamina -> lets you climb a (very) high wall
8. Double jump -> lets you reach high inaccessible area
9. Infinite jumps -> lets you jump across a (very) wide gap
10. Reverse gravity -> lets you fall upwards into an unclimbable hole
11. Noclip -> lets you finish the game


Needed mechanics:

1. Multi-jumps - check!
2. Stamina - check!
3. Glitch area traversal 
4. Multiple biomes with teleportation between them
5. Console
6. Reversable gravity
