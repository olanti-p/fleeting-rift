Collect both RESET and REVEAL functions by moving your character into them, then open debug menu (double press P)
and press 1 for RESET. That'll bring you back to main menu, where you can start a new game and enter the cloud area. 

The invisible wall is in the 3rd room of cloud area, the room where you triggered your first ever checkpoint.
Open debug menu while in that room, then press 2 for the REVEAL hack.
