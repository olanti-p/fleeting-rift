In glitch area, you get explanation of how to open the debug menu (double press P),
and collect 2 functions:
1. RESET lets you return to the start of the game (on web build, don't refresh the browser page, it'll just erase your progress)
2. REVEAL reveals a single invisible impassable wall in cloud area

You have to collect functions (wave blue text) before you can use them.

Exiting glitch areas can only be done via RESET.
